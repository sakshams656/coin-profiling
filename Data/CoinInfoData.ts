An assemblage of computers made up of 'miner' or 'nodes' work in combination to run Bitcoin's code and store its blockchain. It is created and verified by a process called 'mining', which comprises large permutations and combinations of computing power. Bitcoin is referred to as 'BTC' on trading platforms, and all other crypto assets are collectively described as 'altcoins' owing to being adherents to Bitcoin as their predecessor. Bitcoins are highly secure as the tokens are maintained using 'keys' which can be public or private. It is almost impossible for human intervention to hack or recreate the same as it is built using a long string of alphanumeric digits. These digits are encrypted mathematics created by an algorithm.",
